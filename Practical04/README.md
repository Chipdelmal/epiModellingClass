_"In this practical, we will: gain familiarity with using Berkeley Madonna to explore the dynamics of discrete- time, stochastic compartmental models, learn how to deal with competing hazards in a stochastic framework, understand the concepts of extinction and critical community size, explore the dynamics of the stochastic SI model, and explore the impact of stochasticity on Ebola outbreak size."_
