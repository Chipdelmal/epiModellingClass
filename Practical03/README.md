_"In this practical, we will: Continue to develop our skills in using Berkeley Madonna to explore the dynamics of models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), understand the importance of including heterogeneities in models of gonorrhea and other sexually-transmitted infections (STIs), and apply our experience with modeling high and low-risk groups to exploring the dynamics of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)."_
