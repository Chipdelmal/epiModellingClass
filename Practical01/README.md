_In this practical, we will see how a compartmental model is developed to reflect the natural history of a specific infection (Ebola, in this case) and how the flow diagram for this model is translated in a system of ordinary differential equation (ODEs).
We will use the closed SEIR model as a starting point, and look at how we can alter this model to reflect the transmission of Ebola in receptive African communities, taking into account both burial practices and either reduced or heightened transmission in hospitals. We will consider a short-lived Ebola outbreak (representative of the outbreaks preceding the current one), as this allows us to ignore births and deaths, aside from those attributed to the infection._
