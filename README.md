# epiModellingClass

Python code for the practicals on class [PBHLTH252B @ University of California, Berkeley](http://jmarshall.berkeley.edu/PBHLTH252BAd.pdf) taught by [John M. Marshall](https://www.marshalllab.com/).

_"The goal of this course is to lead students through the process of designing mathematical models of infectious diseases, fitting these models to data, and using them as public health tools to design effective control strategies. Examples are drawn from HIV, influenza, TB, mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, and recent outbreaks such as Zika, Ebola and SARS. Each class consists of a lecture followed by a computer-based activity to apply the material. Students also work on a project in which they design their own model and use it to answer a specific research question. Deep mathematical knowledge is not required as the goal of the course is to teach modeling skills to epidemiologists; however, students should be able to write and interpret ordinary differential equations, and to manipulate code in R. A modeling program called Berkeley Madonna will also be used to code differential equations and will be taught in-class."_
